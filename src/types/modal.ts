/**
 * The field descriptions that `promptModal` builds a form dialog from, and

 * This file uses one interface per field kind, instead of one wide shape.
 * `rows` only means something to a pill grid. `emptyText` only means
 * something to a multiselect. A single union member that lists every
 * property lets a caller write `emptyText` on a number field with no
 * complaint. Discriminating on `type` also tells a reader which properties
 * a kind actually reads. The previous flat shape did not.
